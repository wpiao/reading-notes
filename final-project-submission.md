# Final Project: Individual Submission  

## Overall Contributions  
I did the scaffolding the base code so that everyone could start from the same starting code. I devided the project into 4 sections and made separate js file and css file for each sections so that we could avoid merge conflict as many as possible. I spent the most of time to help other team members to tackle their challenges. I connected all individual components and make it work as intended. I resolved the issues that happened after merging the code.   
I completed the shopping cart section with all functionalities. 
  - Render product sections based on the branch information from the previous section.  
  - Add items to the shopping cart and render them in the table.
  - Update items in the shopping cart and re-render the cart appropriately.
  - Delete items in the shopping cart by clicking a remove button and re-render the cart accordingly.
  - Automatically calculate the subtotal and total when there are changes in the shopping cart.

## Collaboration Contributions  
We used zoom for collaborations and used slack for the primary communication method during the project. Everyday, we started with quick standup and then worked on the individual components. I spent quite some time to help team members when they had difficulties.
