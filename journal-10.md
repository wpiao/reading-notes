# Journal-10 - 2/10/2021

- In lab-10a, I was pair-programming with Marie and we were mocking an example webpage and trying to style it as same with the example as possible. The HTML portion was easy but we spent a good 2.5 hours on CSS. We styled it from top to bottom, from left to right and we finished all the styling except one - strike-through feature for the checkbox. 
- In lab-10b, I did the final touch on styling - background color, font color, etc. I finished all the features including stretch goals in previous labs, so I didn't spend a lot of time in this lab. 
- In lab-10c, I did some fun git practices. I have experience with the most commonly used git command, so this lab was not hard for me.
