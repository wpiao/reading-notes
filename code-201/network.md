- Who you met with  
I met with Chun and she works at Amazon as AWS Support Engineer.   

- How you are connected to them   
We knew each other in the Army, we got out of the Army around the same time, and we both work at the Amazon now. She is an AWS support engineer and I am a software development engineer.

- What you learned about that person and their work   
Customer obsession is one of the important leadership principles in Amazon cultures. As an AWS support engineer, she interacts with a lot of different customers. Her job is to take care of the trouble tickets as efficiently as possible. In order to accomplish it, she has to prioritize the trouble tickets and communicate well with her teammates. 

- How you can help them    
My team hasn't worked with her team before. If her team wants to add some features on trouble ticket systems to improve productivity, I think my team could potentially help them with designing and implementing.
