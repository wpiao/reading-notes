# Meetup: Cybersecurity Tech & Discovery Sessions - 2/18/2021

I attended a cybersecurity topic meetup on 2/18/2021. I decided to attend this meetup because I am interested in cybersecurity and I was hoping to get some exposure to cybersecurity. This meetup was not the type of meetup I wanted to attend. I thought they will introduce some key concepts and the current trend in the industry. This meetup was for people who are sharing thoughts and visions of their startup company and looking for networking, funding, potential partners and customers. It was great to see those people who find potential opportunities in the industry and share their ideas with potential partners and customers.   

One of the people I met was John, he is the CEO of Atense - a new cybersecurity startup. He has a new idea and 8 patents for a twist on approaching the security landscape. He was looking for potential partners to help with their financial difficulties.   

The other person I met was Corey, who is working in a finance startup company in the bay area. His company provides a finance service that connects their customer to the right lender based on customers' credit reports.
