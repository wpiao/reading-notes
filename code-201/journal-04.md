# Journal-04 - 1/20/2021

I learned JS function, how to declare a function, how to revoke a function, and the benefits of functions. The lab-04 was not hard, it was building off of lab-03, refactor the base code by using functions. And pair programming went very well and we experienced full-cycle of the git flow. And I helped my partner achieve the stretch goal.

## Benefits of a function

- To do task
- Reusable, saving time
- DRY - (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Easier to read / cleaner code / more human friendly
- Single source of truth
- Plan how to do things and write efficient code - refactor

## Git flow

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Make changes and ACP
3. Make PR
4. Review the changes and approve or deny
5. Merge it upon approval
