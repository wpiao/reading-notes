# The Growth Mindset

I totally believe in `the power in believing that you can improve`. I remember the time I started learning english as a third language. It was hard and I was always wondering when could I communicate in English effectively with other people. I knew that I was not there yet at that time. But I knew in my heart that if I kept practcing and believed I can improve everyday, I would get there someday. I had same mindset when I learned my first programming language - JS and it worked. So I will use the growth mindset in this python class too because I know `the power of yet`.
