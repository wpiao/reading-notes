# Retro 19: - Automation and midterm project prep - 2/12/2022

Lab 19 is to use regex to parse the given text and extract phone number and email from it. Personally, I am not good at regex. Everytime I need to use regex, I have to reference the official doc. I did this lab with my mid-term project group. After the lab, we worked on team agreement - cooperation plan, conflict plan, communication plan, work plan, git process.
