# Retro:26 - Intro to Django - 02/26/2022

I learned Django today. Django can do both frontend and backend. It's backend functionalities are powerful and easy to use. But frontend not so much. Today, we used html templates to create multi-page app. I am wondering if Django has capability to create a single-page app. We are going to dig deep on Django for next couple of classes and I am very excited to see and learn what it can do.
