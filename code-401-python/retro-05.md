# Retro: 05 - Linked List - 12/18/2021

The concept and implementation of linked list is almost same as in other programming language. `Node` has `value` property and uses `next` property to reference the next node. `Linked list` uses `head` property to reference the starting point of the linked list. Traverse of the linked list is also same as in other programming language. I don't have any questions about linked list at this time.
