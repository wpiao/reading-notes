# Retro: 07 - Game of Greed II - 12/30/2021

Lab 07 went well. We needed to implement `play` method in `Game` class. The flo file and integration test gave us the clue what the `play` method supposed to do. The method gives players proper prompt and takes input from players and based on players input to proceed the game accordingly. It wasn't hard to implement the functionality. However, we needed to refactor some methods in previous lab to pass the integration test.
