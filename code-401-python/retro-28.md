# Retro: 28 - Django CRUD - 03/05/2022

I personally like to use `venv` to create a virtual environment in python. I learned how to handle environment variable in django project. It needs a external dependencies and also needs several steps to set it up but it is not that hard. I like the way Django handle the CRUD, it is easy to use yet needs practices to get familiar with it.
