# Retro: 03 - Errors, Files, and Packaging - 12/11/2021

Lab 03 went well and I didn't have blockers. For openning a file in python, I prefer `with open("example.txt") as file:` syntax, since I don't need to close the file. Python uses very similar way in other programming languages to handle errors - `try, except`. I implemented `parse_template` function in two different ways. First one was using `loop` and the other one was using `regex`. I am not good at `regex`, but it was very handy for `parse_template` function.
