# Retro: 01 - Intro to Python - 12/04/2021

It's the first day of class and I was exposed to the basic Python. I am not very familiar with Python but I already like its concise syntax and powerful build-in functions and modules. Lab-01 went well. I wrote a script to show users a menu and take input from users and print out corresponding results to the console. There was no blockers.
