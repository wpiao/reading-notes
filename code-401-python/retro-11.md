# Retro: 11 - NumPy - 01/15/2022

Lab 11 went well. I was introduced `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. I don't have to use a lot of functionalities in these libraries for this lab. I went over the official docs of these libraries after I finish the lab. They can do a lot of advanced things. There is no way to learn these two libraries in one or two days. But `numpy` and `matplotlib` are my go-to place when it comes to data analysis or plotting charts, etc.
