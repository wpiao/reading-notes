# Midterm-retro-01 - 02/14/2022

Each of us brought project ideas today and pitched to each other and then we chose two projects for midterm prep #2. After a productive discussion and the input from Roger, we chose `stock simulator` for our last project. And then as a team, we completed prep #3, and prep #4.
