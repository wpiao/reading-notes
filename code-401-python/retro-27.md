# Retro:27 Django Models - 03/03/2022

I didn't have much time to spend on this lab due to work. I will work on it tomorrow night. Django is very versatile framework. It can handle front-end, back-end, and database in one place. I am planning to spend some time to learn more about it during weekend.
