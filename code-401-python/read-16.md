# Read: 16 - Serverless Functions - 02/01/2022

1. Serverless

   - Automatically provisions the computing resources
   - Automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand
   - Automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running

2. Serverless vs. Faas (function as a service)
   FaaS is a subset of serverless. It's the compute paradigm central to serverless, wherein application code or containers run only in response to events or requests.

3. Serverless pros and cons
   - Pros
     - No need to manage resources, so developers can focus on writing code
     - Pay for execution only
     - Serverless is polyglot environment
     - For certain workloads, such as parallel processing, serverless can be both faster and more cost-effective than other forms of compute
   - Cons
     - It doesn't offer the savings for workloads characterized by predictable, steady or long-running processes
     - Code starts
     - It is difficult or impossible to monitor or debug serverless functions using existing tools or processes
     - Vendor lock-in
