# Retro: 12 - Panda and animal shelter - 01/20/2022

Panda is very powerful data analysis tool, we just scratched the surface and played with some methods. I took look at its offical docs and I was amazed about what it can do and also overwhelmed by its number of functionalities. There is no way to master its all functions in a short time unless you use panda a lot in daily work. One hard thing for me about panda is the syntax, it is hard to find the pattern. It takes time to get used to it.
Animal shelter code challenge went well. Since it didn't specify the requirements how to implement it, I just made AnimalShelter class subclass of Queue class. I inherit `__init__` and `enqueue` method from Queue class and override the `dequeue` method. I covered a lot of edge cases and wrote unit tests and passed all the tests.
