# Retro:18 - Cryptography - 02/10/2022

I wasn't able to attend today's class due to work so I didn't do the code challenge today. I will do it later. Cryptography lab went well, I just used several conditional statement to check if it is upper case or lower case, make sure it wrap around when it gets to the last alphabet. I also used `ord` and `chr` to convert between character and its integer representing.
