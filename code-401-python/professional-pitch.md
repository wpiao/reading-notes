# Professional Pitch

My name is Wenhao Piao, I am a software development engineer in Amazon Web Services(AWS). I am an Army veteran with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. I worked in the medical field in the U.S. Army and I have served 4 years of active duty. After Army, I was working as an engineering program manager intern at Oracle. I am a hard worker, team player, problem-solver, and most importantly I love coding and learn new technologies. One of my plans for this year is to learn python and machine learning after work hours.
