# Retro:31 - Django REST Framework and Docker - 03/17/2022

The Django portion of this lab is not different than the previous Django labs. With `djangorestframework`, we don't need to write any templates to build the apis. I couldn't finishe the docker part, it seems like my mac has some issues with docker. I will fix that issue and then finish the docker part of this lab.
