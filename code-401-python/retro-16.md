# Retro: 16 - Serverless, Breadth First Traversal - 02/03/2022

Today's code challenge was implementing a function that takes a tree as input and return a list with tree node values in breadth first traversal. It is not that hard to implement with help of queue to track the node and its children in order. For serverless lab, I didn't have time to complete it due to some priority work needs to be done for my job. I just made a simple "hello world" serverless function and deployed it. I will add other features later.
