1. We took first 30 minutes to clean up the codes, update README file and finilize our MVP. After that I added more to-do items in the board and we started working on MVP_V1.0.1

2. I made sure the last PR works and didn't break any our MVP features. I created MVP_V1.0.0 branch after confirming all MVP features were working. And then I added several to-do items for MVP_1.0.1 features. I took two features and complete deposit and withdraw functionalities.
