# Read:36 - whiteboard advice - 04/02/2022

- Communicate
  - Restate the question - seek affirmation
  - Ask about edge cases
  - Ask about test cases
- Write pseudocode and ask it it makes sense
  If your pseudocode looks good but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code, you have actually earned a lot of points by now.
- Write the actual code and ask if it looks good
- Ask for help if you stuck - Do not remain silent. Tell your thought process and ask for a little hint.
