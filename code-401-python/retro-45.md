# Retro: 45 - Final project preps - 05/07/2022

We kicked off final project today. As a team, we created a team agreement for the project - we went over cooperation plan, conflict plan, communication plan, work plan, and git process.  
We brainstormed project ideas and we choose to build a full-stack e-commerce app. We are going to use `Next.js` to build our front-end and use `Django` to build our back-end.
