# Partner Power Hour 4 - Open conversation with Ryan - 02/05/2022

**presenter**: Ryan Pedersen  
Ryan Pedersen is Principal Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft. His team builds services for Microsoft Azure. Today, we had an open conversation on having a non-traditional background & what life is actually like as a developer. <br>  
A few points learned today:

- Be proactive. Be curios. Take a guess for next step

- Get mentors and communicate with them often.

- Have a growth mindset.
  - Know it all - short lived, not good for long-term growth.
  - Learn it all - preferred growth mindset, leverage to work with others and learn from others.
