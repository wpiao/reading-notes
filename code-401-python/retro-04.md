# Retro: 03 - Classes, and Fixtures - 12/15/2021

Lab 04 went well. The class concepts and usages are not much different from other programming languages. Inheritance from superclass to subclass also works in the same way in other programming languages. The difference I found is that we have to use `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod` decorator to make static method or class method. I don't have any blockers at this time.
