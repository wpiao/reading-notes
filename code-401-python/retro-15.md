# Retro: 15 - Trees - 01/29/2022

I wasn't able to attend today's class. I learned `Tree` data structures before. The basic building block for trees is `Node`. A `Node` can reference 0 or more nodes which is called children. There are two common ways to traverse through a tree - Depth First and Breadth First. There are three ways to implement Depth First traversal - pre-order, in-order, post-order.
