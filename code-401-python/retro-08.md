# Retro: 08 - Game of Greed III - 01/06/2022

Code challenge 09 was ok. The problem domain was not hard at all. I asked interviewer if I had access for list method or LinkedList class and its methods. He told me I had access but when it came to use list reverse method and LinkedList append method, he said I cannot use it. So I had to handle reversing the list which is not that hard. But append a node to a linked list while iterating over a list, it is not easy to do that in 30 minutes while doing other whiteboard process.
