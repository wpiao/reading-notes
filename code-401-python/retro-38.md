# Retro:38 - React II - 04/09/2022

I realized that I really like React hook, it enables functional component to manage state and it is very component. And we can also write custom hooks when it is needed - such as `useInput` custom hooks. Tailwind is very cool library to handle css and its syntax is very like bootstrap library, but it takes time to get used to it.
