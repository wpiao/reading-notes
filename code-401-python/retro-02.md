# Retro: 02 - Modules, Containers, and Testings - 12/09/2021

Lab 02 and code challenge 02 went well. There was no blockers. `__name__ == "__main__"` is new to me. It is very interesting to see how python determine if the program runs as a script or a module. The syntax of for loop in python is a little bit different than other programming languages. Pythan use `range` or `enumerate` when we need index for looping. It is a little bit difficult to write backward loop in python. Overall, I like python concise syntax.
