# Read: 01 - Big O Notation - 12/03/2021

Big O notations:

- Performance or complexity of an algorithm
- Worst-case scenario execution time or space used

1. O(1) - constant - an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
2. O(log N) - logarithms - an algorithm that eliminate half of the inputs in each iteration until it finish the task.
3. O(N) - Linear - an algorithm whose performance will grow linealy and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
4. O(N^2) - an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
5. O(2^N) - an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
