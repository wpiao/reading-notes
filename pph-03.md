Zero Trust Everything
trust nothing, protect everything.

- Keep patches up to date
- Keep virus signatures up to date
- keep your AI model trained

Work from home - more valnerable

Enter zero trust security: Assume imperfection!

key idea: polymorphic principle
Assume imperfections and make exploiting flaws more difficult
security = entropy > information leakage
Example: Passwords and Multi-Factor Auth

Zero Trust Networking
Leakage: with atraditional perimeter firewallm one breach gives access to the corporate network-often, the entire network
Entropy: individually authenticate and route every user for every service

Zero Trust Data
Leakage: Encryption is only as good as the key management system. Stolen keys = stolen data.
Entropy: Blockchains and similar approaches created autidable, distributed "chains of trust". One compromised key cannot break the full chain.

Zero Trust software
Leakage: Attackers know every single bit in every binary of your software-including the bugs.
Entropy: Change the software! Ploymorphic binaries and script engines change faster than can be discovered. Attacks fail, even on unpatched systems.
