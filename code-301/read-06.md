# Read: 06 - Node.js - 4/6/2021   

## Node.js     
`Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript and libuv library.    

1. Run js file on Node.js   
`node <js file name>`   

2. Installing a package globally and locally    
    - `npm install -g <package name>` - global installation   
    - `npm init -y` - generate `package.json` file

3. Advantages of Node.js    
    - Used both in client-side and server-side    
    - Speed and scalability   
    - JSON
    - Ubiquitous - transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.
