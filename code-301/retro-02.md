# Retro: 02 - React Props & State - 3/27/2021   

Code challenge 02 went well. It was an exercise about array map function. I finished it including stretch goals. Lab 02 also went very well. I added a state to the HornedBeasts component so that when users click the image, the state will be updated and re-render it. I don't have any questions at this time.
