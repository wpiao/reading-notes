# Retro: 11 - 4/26/2021

Lab 11 went well. From this lab to lab 14, it requires pair programming. I and my partner - Allee started this lab by making a pairing agreement so that we could get the most out of it. This lab comes with a starter code and we were asked to implement oath0. I was a navigator and Allee took the driver role. As a navigator, I went slow and explain the things I let her do and make sure we were on the same page. It took us about 3.5 hours to complete it and I don't have any questions regarding this lab.
