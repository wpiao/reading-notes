# Retro: 13 - 5/4/2021

In lab 13, my partner and I worked together to build the post and delete routes in the backend. For `post` route, our backend receives the required data through `req.body`. For `delete` route, our backend receives the required data through `req.query` and `req.params`.  
In the frontend, we created a form embedded in a modal using `react-bootstrap`. This form collects book data and add this data to our mongoDB when users click on the `Add Book` button. We added a delete button to each slide of the carousel for deletion functionality.
