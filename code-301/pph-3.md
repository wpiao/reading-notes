## Why whiteboarding

- A popular way of interviewing
- Actually relevant in the workplace
  - how you think through problems
  - how you collaborate
- The same way of thinking can be applied to another interview process

## Data structures

- A way to store data
- how we file them away
- how to retrieve them
- Common data structures
  - Queues (FIFO)
  - Stacks (FILO)
  - Hashmaps
  - Array

## What to do during whiteboarding

- Slow down
- think things out loud
- try to have a conversation with your interviewer
- listen
- process
- ask good questions
  - this is what I know...
  - these are the requirements...
  - this is the problem...
  - this is how I might approach it...
  - the plus side to my approach
  - downside to my approach

## Whiteboarding steps
