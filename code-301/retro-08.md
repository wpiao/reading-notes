# Retro: 08 - 04/17/2021

Lab 08 went well. I built it off lab 07. I added get request on `/movies` in the front-end and created a `Movie` component that would use movie data from the response to render it. I added two paths - `/weather` and `/movies` in the back-end to handle the get request from font-end. `/weather` path would make a get request to the appropriate API to get the weather data and modify it and then send it back to the front-end. `/movies` path does the same thing. I deployed the front-end in the Netlify and the back-end in the Heroku.
