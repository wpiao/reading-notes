# Retro: 12 - 5/1/2021

Lab 12 went well. My partner and I worked together to built the express server and then connected mongoDB to it. And then we seeded our database and set up `/books` route. In thefrontend side, we created `BestBooks` component and only render it when user log into the app. And then we setup the API call to the `/books` route and make sure this call only happens after component mount.
