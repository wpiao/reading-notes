# Retro: 14 - 5/8/2021

In lab 14, my partner and I added `PUT` route to the back-end and then used `swagger inspector` to test the route. After confirmed the `PUT` route works properly, we switched to the front-end and added `update` functionality to each book. I don't have any questions regarding this lab.
