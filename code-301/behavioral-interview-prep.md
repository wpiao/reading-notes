# Behavioral Interview Prep   

1. Tell me a time when you were able to foresee a customer problem?   

S/T: In 2018 winter, my unit received an order to deploy to the Arizona border in 72 hours. My command team gave us a short briefing about the mission and I packed medical supply and equipment accordingly. I had one concern at that time - weather. The winter here in Washington is cold, wet, rainly, and cloudy. But winter in Arizona is very hot, sunny, and dry in the daytime. The temperature difference between two places could be as high as 50 degrees. I was afraid that if we don't prepare for this weather, we might see some heat injuries, sunburn, dehydration, etc. And all these injuries were preventable.    

A: I shared my concerns with my commander and I told him I needed to buy supply to prepare for this. The commander agreed with me and approved my purchase plan. So I worked with the supply manager to purchase sunscreens and hydration kits for everyone and distribute it to them. I also conducted a quick class about how to prevent and treat heat injuries.   

R: As a result, during 5 months of mission, my unit didn't see any heat related injuries whereas some other units reported heat injuries in their unit.   

2. Tell me a time when you had to say NO to a customer?   

S/T: I remembered a time my unit was in the field for training and one of my soldiers was complaining about back pain during the training. I assessed her back and decided to give her pain-killers. I gave her proper dosage but she asked for more. She said she used to take extra dosage.   

A: I had to say no to her, because it was not the right way to take medication and I had to persuade her for her own good. I told her any medications have side effects. When it comes to pain-killers, she has to start to take it from lower dosage. If it doesn't work, then gradually increase the dosage until it works. If she takes the higher dosage in the beginning, it would build the tolerance and eventually that medication will no longer work on her. And that happens, she has to switch to stronger pain-killers or narcotics which have more side effects and potentially cause addiction problems.   

R: After the conversation, she agreed to try the dosage I gave her. I assured her that I would be around her all the time. If she still feels pain, come to me any time and I will give her an extra pill. Luckily, she didn't come to me that day and she knows what dosage works for her from that day on.    

3. Tell me about a time when you failed at work?    

S/T: One of my jobs in the Army was to make a unit medical readiness report and this report dues every Tuesday at 3 pm. I used to make the report on Tuesday morning because I want to pull the most recent data from the database and use it on my report. But one Tuesday morning, I was told I have to support a machine gun range because the medic who was supposed to cover that range couldn't make it due to personal emergency. And this range would take a whole day and I definitely was going to miss the deadline for the report.    

A: I communicated with my supervisor and I apologized to him about what was going to happen. It was all on me, because I should have been prepared for the situation like this. I assured him that this would not happen again.   

R: From that day on, I made my report on Monday morning just in case, and if I have time on Tuesday, I updated it. By doing that, I never missed the deadline after that.
