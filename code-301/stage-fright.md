# Stage Fright

Public speaking is one of my weaknesses, especially public speaking in English. English is my third language and sometimes it is hard for me to organize thoughts and speak effectively in English. But I found out that most people have the same fear and even famous public speakers have stage fright. They do well in public speaking because they prepare well and practice it a lot and overcome the fear. Here are the things I will implement to overcome stage fright.

- Prepare the speaking, write down the key points and practice it.
- Take a deep breath and focus the attention on thoughts and images that are calming and reassuring.
- Make connections with the audience: Smile and greet people, thinking of them as friends.
