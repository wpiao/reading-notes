# Final Project: Individual Submission - 5/20/2021

## Overall Contributions

First of all, I drew the wireframe and created the frontend and backend repo and scrafoldding the base code. I took charge the daily standup and merge party. I created most of the backend routes and their functionalty. I spent some time working on connection pieces between the frontend and backend, plugging the data, and react state management. I spent quite some time helping teammates with their challenges.

## Collaboration Contributions

I took charged daily standup and merge party. Everyday we started with standup and then put the tasks in the trello board. We decide to do pair programming or solo coding based on the task. When it comes to PR review, we went through the files change and explain the code one by one so that everyone could learn from each other's code. I spent some time helping my teammates with their challenges.
