# Retro: 09 - 4/20/2021

Lab 09 went very well. I didn't add any new features to my app, I refactored my code for readability and cleanness. For the back-end, I moved external API calls to a separate file under the handlers folder. For the front-end, I added two more components and change the `Movie` component from the `Carousel` to the `Card column`. I don't have any questions at this time. It took me around one hour to complete it.
