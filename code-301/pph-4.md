**Presenter: Rob Eleveld, Stacy Chen**
**Topic: Becoming a confident communicator in the tech world!**

Today we had Ekata CEO - Rob Eleveld and chief of staff - Stacy Chen to share some advice on becoming a confident communicator in the tech world.

## 5 Simple rules for confident communication

### Rule #1: Be extraordinarily clear on what your strengths are

- Follow through is critical  
  Most people don't do what they say they are going to
- Own what you don't or can't do
  Just as important as enforcing what we do offer
- High internal and external self-awareness  
  Know who you are, what you want to accomplish and seek out and value other opinions

### Rule #2: Embody Trust and Transparency

- Building teamwork
  Listening, collaborating, and being open to your teammates globally
- Push accountability to the edge  
  Empowering global teams to make decisions on their own

### Rule #3: Build enduring relationships

- Make deposits when you know you will need to make withdrawals  
  Treating customers, peers, mentors with respect
- Bad news doesn't age well  
  Be super upfront and stop any erosion of messages

### Rule #4: Look bigger than you are

- Punch above your weight
  No matter how lean your skillset or experience, always push for more
- Repeat the message  
  Reinforce the same messages so your audience knows your key points (ex. strengths in an interview)

### Rule #5: Don't apologize for what you don't have or know

- "Relative to all of us, you are the expert"
- Keep putting one foot in front of the other
