# Meetup Topic: Web scraping - 5/21/2021

This wasn't a formal meetup. I was with my 14 colleagues to discuss about topics we were intertested personally. Some colleagues were talking about machine learning and I was talking about web scraping. There are a couple of ways to collect the data from the internet. One popular way is through API but not all the website provides API. The other popular way is through web scraping. Web scraping extracts data from underlying HTML.

I used a python library called `beautifulsoup` to extract the a specific stock information from Yahoo finance. My plan was using these data to render a real-time stock price tracker. I didn't get it finished yet but it is in progress. One of my colleagues introduced us another python library called `Selenium`. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes. It also allows you to open browser of your choice and perform tasks as a human being would. Most of the website is dynamically rendered and some data only shows when events are triggered, such as clicking buttons, submitting the form, etc. `Selenium` can perform these events and makes data scraping easy for those dynamically rendered page. I am really interested in `Selenium` and I will dig into it after I complete the project with `beautifulsoup`.
