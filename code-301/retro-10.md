# Retro: 10 - 4/24/2021

Lab 10 went well. It has back-end starter code with some bugs. My job was to find all bugs and fix it. Firstly, I hooked up my front-end city explorer to this back-end. And then I run the server, let the error message pinpoint the bugs. I fixed them one by one until there is no bugs left.
