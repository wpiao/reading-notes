# Coffee meeting

I had a conversation with Chun and she works at Amazon as AWS Support Engineer. We knew each other in the Army, we got out of the Army around the same time, and we both work at the Amazon now. She is an AWS support engineer and I am a software development engineer at AWS.

We talked about customer obsession. Customer obsession is one of the important leadership principles in Amazon cultures. As an AWS support engineer, she interacts with a lot of different customers. Her job is to take care of the trouble tickets as efficiently as possible. In order to accomplish it, she has to prioritize the trouble tickets and communicate effectively with her teammates. And as a SDE, I implement similar practice to interact with my customers.
