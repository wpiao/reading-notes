# Retro: 03 - Passing Functions in Props - 3/30/2021    

Code challenge 03 was about array's filter method. It is one of the popular array method and I completed it including the stretch goal. Lab 03 went very well. I added a state that stores the clicked picture's info to the App component and wrote a function that updates this state and passed it to HornedBeasts component through Main component. I created SelectedBeast component by using React Bootstrap and used the state to control the rendering of this component in the modal.
