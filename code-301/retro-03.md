# Retro: 03 - Passing Functions in Props - 3/30/2021    

Code challenge 03 was about the array's filter method. It is one of the popular array methods and I completed it including the stretch goal. Lab 03 went very well. I added a state that stores the clicked picture's info to the `App` component and wrote a function that updates this state and passed it to the `HornedBeasts` component through the `Main` component. I created the `SelectedBeast` component by using `React Bootstrap` and used the state to control this component's rendering in the modal.
