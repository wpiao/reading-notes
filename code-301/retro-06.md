# Retro: 06 - API Calls - 4/10/2021   

Lab 06 went well. We learned how to make API calls to the endpoint to get data back. I first built the front-end using `React` and then formatted the URL the way the endpoint required. And then I made a `GET` request to the endpoint and got the data back. I sotred the data in the state and passed it to the appropriate component to render it. I used `Trello` to manage the whole process.
