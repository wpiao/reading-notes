# Retro: 04 - Forms & Filter - 04/03/2021   

The code challenges 04 is about the array sort method. I completed it including the stretch goals. Some compare callback function was needed a little bit more logic. Lab 04 went well. Since I completed lab 03 stretch goal - the search box, it is easy to implement the filter. I created a `select form` component by using `react-bootstrap` and added it to the `App` component. And then added a function that filter and updated the data, pass it to `select form` component through props.
