## Functional programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## Pure functions

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as `deterministic`)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
- Pure functions benefits
  - The code's definitely easier to test

## Functions as first-class entities

- refer to it from constants and variables
- pass it as a parameter to other functions
- return it as result from other functions

## Higher-order functions

- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as its result
