# Retro: 05 - Deployment - 4/6/2021   

Lab 05 went very well. This lab has starter code and all I needed to do was read the code and understand the connection pieces. After I had general understanding about the starter code, I replaced the previous content with my content and then deleted all the unused or irrelevant components. I don't have any questions about this lab. It took me 45 minutes to complete it.
