# Meetup: Cybersecurity Tech & Discovery Sessions - 2/18/2021

I attended a cybersecurity topic meetup on 2/18/2021. I decided to attend this meetup because I am interested in the cybersecurity and I was hoping to get some exposures on cybersecurity. This meetup was not the type of meetup I wanted to attend to. I thought they will introduce us some key concepts and current trend in the industry. This meetup was for people who is sharing thoughts and visions of their startup company and looking for networking, funding, potential partners and customers. It was great to see those people who find the potential opportunity in the industry and share their ideas with potential partners and customers.   

One of the people I met was John, he is the CEO of Atense - a new cybersecurity startup. He has a new idea and 8 patents for a twist on approaching the security landscape. He was looking for potential partners to help their financial difficulty.   

The other person I met was Corey, he is working in a finance startup company in the bay area. His company provides a finance service that connects their customer to the right lender based on customers' credit report.
