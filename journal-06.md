# Journal-06 - 1/27/2021

I learned JS object literals and Document Object Model (DOM). We went over creating objects, adding properties or methods to an object, and DOM manipulations. Lab-06 went very well and I didn't have any difficulties when I did it.

## Key takeaways

1. JS Object literals

- Create an object - `const seattle = {name: 'seattle'}; // key-value pair`
- Access property:
  - Dot notation - `seattle.name`
  - Square bracket notation - `seattle['name']`
- Add property - `seattle.state = 'WA'`

2. DOM manipulation

-
- Create the element
- Give it content
- Append to the DOM, append to its parent or directly to the DOM
